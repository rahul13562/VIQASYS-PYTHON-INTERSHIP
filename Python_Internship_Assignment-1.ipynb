    "A string and a variable are both fundamental concepts in computer programming, but they serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. String:\n",
    "   - A string is a data type used to represent text or a sequence of characters.\n",
    "   - It is typically enclosed within single quotes (' ') or double quotes (\" \") in most programming languages.\n",
    "   - Examples of strings include \"hello\", \"123\", \"This is a string!\", etc.\n",
    "   - Strings are immutable in many programming languages, meaning they cannot be changed once created.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variable:\n",
    "   - A variable is a symbolic name or identifier associated with a value in a computer program.\n",
    "   - It serves as a placeholder for storing data that can be changed or manipulated during the execution of the program.\n",
    "   - Variables can hold various types of data, including strings, integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, etc.\n",

    "1. Integer (int):\n",
    "   - An integer is a data type used to represent whole numbers without any decimal or fractional part.\n",
    "   - Integers can be positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "   - Examples of integers include -10, 0, 42, 100, etc.\n",
    "   - Integers are often used for counting, indexing, and arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. String:\n",
    "   - A string is a data type used to represent text or a sequence of characters.\n",
    "   - Strings are typically enclosed within single quotes (' ') or double quotes (\" \") in most programming languages.\n",
    "   - Examples of strings include \"hello\", \"123\", \"This is a string!\", etc.\n",
    "   - Strings are commonly used for representing textual data, such as names, messages, file paths, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Float (Floating-point number):\n",
    "   - A float is a data type used to represent numbers with a decimal point or fractional part.\n",
    "   - Floats can represent a wide range of real numbers, including both rational and irrational numbers.\n",
    "   - Examples of floats include -3.14, 0.5, 2.71828, etc.\n",
    "   - Floats are commonly used in scientific calculations, financial applications, and any scenario requiring precise decimal values.\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "An expression is made up of a combination of variables, constants, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a value. In programming, expressions can take various forms, such as arithmetic expressions, logical expressions, string expressions, etc. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arithmetic expression: 2 + 3 * x\n",
    "- Logical expression: x > 5 and y < 10\n",
    "- String expression: \"Hello, \" + name\n",

    "The general purpose of expressions is to compute or evaluate a value based on the provided inputs or operands. Expressions allow programmers to perform operations, manipulate data, and make decisions within their programs. They are essential building blocks in programming languages, enabling the creation of complex algorithms and logic to solve various problems. Additionally, expressions are often used in assignments, comparisons, function calls, and control flow statements to perform specific tasks and achieve desired outcomes in a program."

    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between expressions and statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluation:\n",
    "   - Expressions are evaluated to produce a value. For example, 2 + 3 is an expression that evaluates to 5.\n",
    "   - Statements, on the other hand, are not evaluated to produce a value. They perform actions or operations in a program. For example, x = 5 is a statement that assigns the value 5 to the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Termination:\n",
    "   - Expressions do not terminate a program execution. They are often used as part of statements or within larger expressions. For example, total = x + y is a statement that assigns the sum of x and y to the variable total, where x and y could be expressions.\n",
    "   - Statements, however, can terminate a program execution, depending on their purpose and context. For example, return statements in functions terminate the function execution and return a value to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Examples:\n",
    "   - Expression: 2 * (3 + 4) evaluates to 14.\n",
    "   - Statement: x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.\n"
